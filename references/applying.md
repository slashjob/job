# Application forms per ATS

Reaching, reading and filling a form with the Playwright MCP tools. This action ends with the form
filled and staged; the user submits.

## Who answers a field

Name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub, work authorization, sponsorship, EEO, start date and
compensation all come from `identity` — fill them without asking.

Screening questions and essays have no stored answer. Write what the profile supports. Where nothing supports an answer, raise it with the user, **except**
when a row in `projects` plainly answers it — then answer and cite that project, so the reasoning is
there to check. A question needing a project that is not in `projects` is a question for the user,
not an inference.

**An open-ended fit question is a different question from a factual one.** "Have you deployed X?"
is answered from `projects`. "Why are you the ideal candidate", "why this company", and whatever
essay the posting asks for in its own words are not: the resume in the same submission already
tells that story, and retelling one project spends the field on something the reader already has.
Answer it as the match instead — what the posting asks for, what in the record meets each ask, and
the one that does not. **The gap, named plainly, is the part the resume cannot supply**, and it
reads as someone who knows the shape of the job. Draft it in the conversation and let the user take
it before it reaches the field. **If the match cannot be made honestly, that is its own finding**:
say so, and ask whether the posting is worth an application at all.

**What they answer is written to the profile before the field is filled** — the form holds only this
application's wording.

## Reaching the form

**A row's `url` is a listing, not an application form** — on the employer's own site when the
search could follow it there, otherwise on a board. Resolving it to the employer's own form is the
first half of this action, and the employer's form beats a board-hosted one whenever both exist.

1. **Take the listing's own apply link.** It redirects to the employer's ATS for anything the board
   does not host itself. That is the cheap path and it works most of the time. On Indeed the link is
   `https://www.indeed.com/applystart?jk=<jk>&from=vj`.
2. **Search the web when it dead-ends** — a board-hosted form, an expired listing, or a redirect
   that lands on a careers homepage. Search the exact title plus the company name, and prefer a
   result on an ATS domain over the employer's marketing page.
3. **Store what you land on.** `staged.url` is the form actually filled, so a later run does not
   resolve it twice.

**Confirm it is the same role before filling.** A search can land on a different opening at the same
employer. Title and location must match the prospect; if they do not, flag it rather than applying.

Once landed, **the domain names the ATS** — that is what the table below is keyed on, not the
prospect key, whose `<source>:` half names only where the posting was read.

| ATS | Apply URL | Notes |
| --- | --------- | ----- |
| **Ashby** | Job URL + `/application` | Renders client-side; wait, below |
| **Greenhouse** | `job-boards.greenhouse.io/<slug>/jobs/<id>` | Career pages embed this in an iframe; go to the canonical URL |
| **Lever** | `jobs.lever.co/<slug>/<id>/apply` | Server-rendered and predictable, but **submission is gated by hCaptcha** |
| **Workday** | `<company>.wd<N>.myworkdayjobs.com/…` | **Fully drivable.** Needs a per-employer account, then a five-step flow |
| **Board-hosted** | The listing itself | Indeed Apply and the like; the resume upload is the same, the screening questions are the board's |
| **Everything else** | Where the redirect landed | iCIMS, SuccessFactors, Oracle Cloud, Rippling, SmartRecruiters, BambooHR, Eightfold and 40-odd more. Untested, one at a time: **do not assume any of them is blocked** — open it and look before writing it off |

An ATS met for the first time is worth a note in this file once it is driven — that is how the table
above earned its rows.

**Wait for the form before snapshotting.** Ashby renders "Fetching application form" first, and a
snapshot taken too early shows a page with no fields on it. All three go in one message:

```
browser_tabs      → action: new, url: <apply URL>
browser_wait_for  → textGone: "Fetching application form"
browser_snapshot
```

Greenhouse and Lever are usually ready on load; snapshot and check for field refs before assuming.
Clear `.playwright-mcp/` at the end of a run.

**Check for a duplicate before staging**: `$Q "SELECT status FROM prospects WHERE key='…'"`. A second
application to the same role reads as carelessness and can burn a stated limit.

## Filling

**One snapshot fills the form.** Read every field off it, then set them all in one
`browser_fill_form`, targeting by selector where the field has an `id` or `name`. Look again only
where a field changes the page: a typeahead, or an answer that reveals more fields.

| Field type | Handling |
| ---------- | -------- |
| `textbox` | Direct value through `browser_fill_form` |
| `radio` | Value is the option's exact label text |
| `checkbox` | `true` / `false` |
| `combobox` | Type, then click the option |
| `button` pairs | `browser_click`; confirms by picking up `[active]` |

**Yes/No appears as two shapes, and only the snapshot tells them apart**: `radio` elements, which
`browser_fill_form` sets by label, or `button "Yes"` / `button "No"` pairs, which need
`browser_click` and ignore `fill_form` entirely. Read the element type first.

**Location fields are typeaheads.** Ashby's `Location*` is a combobox with a `Start typing…`
placeholder:

```
browser_type  → target: <combobox ref>, text: "Denver", slowly: true
browser_click → the matching option
```

The dropdown renders as a `listbox` **detached at the very end of the snapshot**, outside the form
container. The first option is highlighted but **not committed until clicked** — confirm with
`browser_find` in the same message as the click: the combobox should read
`Denver, Colorado, United States`, not `Denver`.

**Refs go stale after every interaction.** Clicking an option renumbers refs elsewhere on the page —
sponsorship buttons moved `e138/e139` → `e390/e391` after one typeahead selection. Target the fields
after it by selector, or take fresh refs from `browser_find`; a stale ref errors rather than
misclicking, so this costs a retry.

**Resume upload** needs the file chooser triggered first, and absolute paths only. Attach the
tailored PDF for that role, never a generic one.

```
browser_click       → the "Upload File" button
browser_file_upload → paths: ["/absolute/path/to/resume.pdf"]
```

**Skip "Autofill from resume."** Auditing what it guessed costs more than filling the fields
explicitly from the profile.

**The profile stores the answer, not the wording.** `identity.over_18` is `1` and
`identity.employment_type` is `full_time`; the form wants "Yes" and "Full-time". Say it the way
that form says it, and never widen the answer while rewording it -- `0` is "No" however the question
was phrased.

## Before you stop

Re-snapshot and check every required field — marked `*` — holds a value. The silent failures are an
uncommitted typeahead, a radio group that looks answered because one option is visible, and a file
input that never received the upload.

Then `cli/stage.ts add`, naming `--blocked-on` if anything is still unanswered.

**Leave the tab open. The filled form is the record.** Whatever the user needs to weigh in on, raise
it in the conversation while the tab is open.

`cli/profile.ts answers` and `cli/profile.ts missing` are where the stored answers come from, and which of
them are still `NULL`.

**A start date is computed, not stored.** Every employer has a `finish` date and they can start at once;
otherwise it is today plus `identity.notice_period`. Never carry a date over from an earlier
application — the answer moves with the day the form is asked.

**Then stop.** Do not click Apply, Continue, or Next either. On a multi-page form, stop
at the end of the first page and record the page count.

## Lever specifics

**hCaptcha gates the submit button**, and fires only on that click, so the form still fills
unattended. A challenge that renders while filling is invariant 6.

**The resume input is hidden and overlaid by the captcha iframe**, so a normal click times out with
"subtree intercepts pointer events". Click it through the page instead:

```
browser_evaluate    → target: <file input ref>, function: (element) => element.click()
browser_file_upload → paths: ["/absolute/path/resume.pdf"]
```

**Selecting Disability status reveals two more required fields** — a Name and a Date (`MM/DD/YYYY`)
appear under the EEO block only after the dropdown is set, and are required once it is. Re-snapshot
after setting it. **Dismiss the cookie banner first** (Deny works); it overlays the form on load.

## Workday specifics

**An account is required, one per employer** — tenants are separate. Creation needs an email, a
password (8+ chars, mixed case, numeric, special) and a privacy checkbox, then an emailed activation
link. That link is single-use; "Invalid Token" means the user already clicked it — just sign in.

**Never invent, generate, or store a password.** Ask the user to create one in their password
manager.

**Apply Manually** starts five steps: My Information, My Experience, Application Questions, Voluntary
Disclosures, Review. `Save and Continue` advances and does not submit; only `Submit` on step 5 does.
Each step takes a few seconds to render, so wait before snapshotting.

**Required fields appear mid-flow** — "Are you a previous employee?" only surfaced as a validation
error after the first `Save and Continue`, so read the Errors Found panel rather than assuming the
page was complete. **Work Experience, Education and Skills are optional** when a resume is attached.
**The form carries a bot honeypot**, a hidden input labelled "for robots only" — leave it empty.

## Traps

- **Published salary ranges.** Ashby prints the band on the posting. Read it before answering any
  compensation field: answering a $120,000 floor against a published $180K–$240K band anchors the
  negotiation sixty thousand dollars below where the employer opened it.
- **Application limits.** Some companies state them ("5 per 90 days"). `postings` records every
  application with its company and date — count what has already gone there before staging another.
- **Cover letter fields** are usually optional. Leave optional essay fields empty rather than filling
  them with something generic; a weak answer costs more than no answer.
- **"How did you hear about us?"** — answer the company's job board, which is true.
- **Login walls.** Some forms require an account before showing any fields — flag for the user, and
  stage what is reachable.
