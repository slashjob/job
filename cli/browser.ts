  cli/browser.ts status   say whether it is up
  cli/browser.ts endpoint print the endpoint and nothing else

Playwright MCP attaches to this browser over CDP instead of launching its own,
so the window outlives any one conversation: a form left half-filled, a captcha
waiting on you, and the accounts you are signed into all survive between runs.

Its profile is ${PROFILE}, apart from your everyday Chrome. Closing the window loses whatever was open in it; the profile, and what you are signed into, stays.`,
